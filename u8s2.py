UNDERSTAND
  what are we tasked to do, what value are we supposed to look for?
  what node should replace our removed node?
    -if we take a good look at our examples we should notice that when we have     two children, the inorder successor that would replace that node is also       the min node for its right subtree.
    -look for min to replace in case of two children nodes
  what can we take advantage of?
  base cases?

Problem 5: BST In-order Successor
In the remove_bst() problem, we summarized the in-order successor of a given node as the smallest node in the given nodeâ€™s right subtree. This is true if the given node has a right subtree.

More generally, the in-order successor is the node with the smallest key greater than the key of the given node. Given the root of a binary search tree, and a TreeNode current, write a function that returns the in-order successor of the current node. Assume the tree is balanced.
